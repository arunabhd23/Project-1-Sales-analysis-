## About the Project

In this Sales Analysis Jupyter notebook, we perform Exploratory Data Analysis of the huge Sales data by following the  tasks mentioned below. We try to answer the following set of real-world business questions to draw insights from this huge Sales dataset.



### The Dataset
The dataset contains `12` CSV files containing sales details for the 12 months of the year 2019. The naming convention is as follows: Sales_[MONTH_NAME]_2019\
Each file contains anywhere from around `9000` to `26000` rows and `6` columns. The columns are as follows:\
`Order ID`,	`Product`, `Quantity Ordered`, `Price Each`, `Order Date`, `Purchase Address`


### Tasks

* Task 1: Merge 12 months of sales data into a single CSV file
* Task 2: Create new 'Month' column from 'Order Date' column
* Task 3: Add a Sales column
* Task 4: Add a City column

### Questions

* Question 1: What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
* Question 2: What city has the highest sales?
* Question 3: What time should we display advertisements to maximize likehood of customers buying products?
* Question 4: What products are most often sold together?
* Question 5: What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?
